_Science has never been defined by infallibility or superhuman perfection. It has always been abouthealthyskepticism, about putting every hypothesis to the test_.Â \

Hypothesis testing is like legal trial. In law, you assume someone is innocent until proven guilty with enough evidence. Similarly, in statistics, you assume that your null hypothesis is true until you have enough evidence to reject it. In this blog post, I will talk about Hypothesis testing in general. I will mostly cover the type of hypothesis and how to approach a decision making problem with respect to hypothesis testing.
