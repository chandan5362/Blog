## About me
---
Hello there! My name is Chandan Kumar Roy and currently I am in senior year at Indian Institute of information Technology Sricity, Chittoor. I am doing my major in 
**Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** with specialization in **Data Science**. Apart from core data science subjects like statistics, linear algebra, I also have interest in fields like 
Computer vision, Natural Language Processing. I am a research oriented person and have co-authored one research paper until now. 

## Areas of Interest
---
* Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Computer Vision
* Natural language Processing
* Data Visualization & story telling

## Work Experiences
---
* Currently, I am working at *Episource India Pvt Ltd* as a **Computer Vision intern**. There I am working on automating the medical charts report
for faster and smooth diagnosis of regular patients. Recently, my model has successfully made to the production environment and is higly scalable.

* I have worked as a **Data science intern** with *Learning Evolution Pvt Ltd*. There I mainly worked with the computer vision team. 
My roles and responsibilities were to develop DL models for head pose estimation, gaze estimation, generate facial embeddings, 
face verification system and maintain their lifecycle throught the development phase. I fine-tuned the existing state-of-the-art 
models for our use cases and created a new one wherever necessary. Apart from these, I also worked on kafka queuer for smoothig communication
between models and backend servers.

* I also work as a **freelancer.** To know more about my freelance work, head over to my [profile](https://www.freelancer.in/u/chandan5362). 
My areas of expertise are Python, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Computer vision , Natural Language Processing, 
Data pipelining. In case  you need any help related to any of the aforementioned topics, please ping me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandan5362/).

## Projects
---
* **Spatial mapping of soil nutrients:** It was a part of my semester long project. I along with other two members are 
working together to come up with a deep neural network based mapping technique that can generate a high 
resolution map of a given area based on their geocordinates. We have used many attention techniques that 
can map the spatial relationship among the neigbouring points. You can find the more details about the same [here](https://github.com/chandan5362/Soil-Mapping).

* **Automatic Number plate detection:** it was a part of my deep learning course. I came up with an idea to develop a number 
plate recogniser for Indian Vehicle number plates. There is no any standard Indian Vehicle Number Plate dataset 
available online. Also Vehicle numbering system does not follow any particular convention. So, It was challenging 
to collect the Indian Number plate and manually annotate them. YOLOV3 model was used as a number plate detector and the 
detected cropped image is passed through PyTesseract for digit/number recognition. If you are curious to know more about this project, 
head over to the project [repository](https://github.com/chandan5362/Automatic-Number-plate-Detection---ANPR).

* **FooDE:** It was a part of my Enterprise Application Development course. 
I along with other three members worked together to develop a Food deliver smart web app. 
This project was developed in an agile environment. Trough this project, we got to learn about basic software
engineering practice and developing scalable application. This project can be found [here](https://github.com/chandan5362/FooDE).

* **Multi-Document Text Summarizer:**  This is my personal project that I worked on during my Information retriveal course. 
I found a genuine interest  in IR system and Knowledge mining. It was a basic project made using NLTK and ML models. More details about the project can be found [here](https://github.com/chandan5362/Information-retrieval/tree/main/MUlti-Document%20Text%20summarizer).

* **Smart Driver Monitoring System:** A deep learning, CV and mediapipe based smart driving monitoring framework that supports head pose estimation, drowsiness detection, 
object detection like cell phone, wine glass etc. This project can be found [here](https://github.com/chandan5362/Smart-Driver-Monitoring-System).

## Mini Projects
---
* **Human Action Recognition API** -  Detailed instructions about this API can be found [here](https://github.com/chandan5362/Human-Action-Recognition).
* **IIITS-OJ** -  It's a basic online Judge platfrom for online coding contest. I did It along with other three members while I was exploring web development.[link](https://github.com/chandan5362/IIITS-OJ)
* **Battle of Neighbourhood -**  It was a part of courser capstone project.[link](https://github.com/chandan5362/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Battle-of-Neighbourhood.ipynb)
* **Tic-Tac-Toe Game -** I bet, you can not defeat my AI agentü§ñ. Challenge my AI bot [here](https://github.com/chandan5362/Game-Theory/blob/master/Tic_Tac_Toe.py)
* **Nine men's Morris -**  Get a vibe of old days. It's very interesting. try [here](https://github.com/chandan5362/Game-Theory/blob/master/nine_men_morris.py)
